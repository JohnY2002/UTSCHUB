# Sprint 1

## Sprint 1 Planning Meeting
We had our sprint 1 Planning meeting on the C01 Discord server on September 28th, 2022, with the purpose of choosing which user stories should be included, identifying the associated tasks to the user stories, and dividing the work among the team members. During this meeting, every member of our team was present.

We chose five user stories at the planning meeting that we thought required for the fundamental functionality of our application. These user stories enable users of our application to register, create an account, login to their registered account which has been authenticated at the time of registration. We next divide the user stories into subtasks, utilize planning poker to evaluate the subtasks, and distribute them along with document responsibilities among our members.

## Sprint Goal:
- Learning MERN Stack and other frameworks/tools
- Getting started: Setting up Jira, learning MVC, planning software architectural design for our project
- Backend: creating a sign up/ log in feature, creating and routing events, deleting user, decide how to populate user accounts
- Frontend: creating Landing Page, Sign up page, Login Page, other interfaces.
