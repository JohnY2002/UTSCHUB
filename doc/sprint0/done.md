## What is our team’s definition of a User Story being Done?

- Every user story’s features being developed must be code reviewed and approved by at least two other members to meet the group's criteria. Things to consider before approving PRs are code organisation, readability, documentation, comments, usability, and other factors.

- The features must be modified to address the shared concerns if more than two team members have similar issues.

- At Sprint Review meetings, only the Product Owner has the power to officially 'accept' the completion of User Stories.

- Done signifies that the features being implemented for a specific user story have been developed, tested, and meet the group's requirements.
