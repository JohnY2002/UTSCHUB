1.Done implies that the features being implemented for a specific user story have been developed, tested, and meet the group's requirements.

2.Every user story’s features being developed must be code reviewed and approved by at least two other members to meet the group's criteria. Things to consider before approving PRs are code organisation, readability, documentation, comments, usability, and other factors.
