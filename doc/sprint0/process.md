### Team organization (roles) divided clearly:
- Scrum Master: Muntaqa, Nandhu
- Backend: Andrew, Muntaqa, Nandhu
- Frontend: John, Shence, Shun
- Fullstack: Henry

### How did the team come along? 
The UTSC Hub team was organized and formed with friends and acquaintances met in lecture.

### Which tools did you use, if any? 
Discord is our primary tool of communication. 

### Decision making:
We firstly discuss and list out all the options and opinions from each member and then we either vote or talk about the pros and cons of some features and come to a general consensus. Since there are 7 of us, in case of any voting, 4 votes would be needed to go through with a particular point. 


### Prioritizing user stories:
We discuss the difficulty and pros and cons of the user stories and finally come to a vote. 
We vote on if each user story is either High, Medium or Low Priority. High meaning needs to be done asap, 
Medium means somewhat important and Low means we can do it in the future while keeping it in mind. 

### How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
Approximately one round of voting seems to be enough.
 
### How frequently are you planning to meet? 
We are planning to meet 3 to 4 times a week on discord. The dates set are Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday.

### Next Phase:

- Having shorter meetings and clearly distribute the work during that time. Try to finish the work before 5pm of Friday.
- Communicating well with team members and knowing gitflow workflow properly so that we can avoid merge conflicts and other confusions regarding version control
- Feel free to ask questions to verify any constraints and also feel free to ask for help moving forward.
